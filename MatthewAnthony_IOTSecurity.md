# Project Description: 
The IOT Security Project will be designed for households to be able to scan their home networks and see if there are any current security
holes in their network. The program will print an audit of all IOT devices that are currently connected to thier network. This audit will
include firmware versions, whether a new firmware exits or not, help on how to update, and results from port scans. 

# Educational Goals: 
The goals of this project will teach source code management, along with integration of network scanning code within Java. This project will
also include test driven development. All of these are important with the growth of IOT Security. 

# Proposed Contribution:
I plan on creating an open-source project, and starting from the ground up.
