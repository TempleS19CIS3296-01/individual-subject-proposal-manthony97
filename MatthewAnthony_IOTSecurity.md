# Project Description: 
The IoT Security Project will be designed for households to be able to scan their home networks and see if there are any current security
holes in their network. The program will print an audit of all the IoT devices that are currently connected to thier network. This audit will include firmware versions, whether a new firmware version exits or not, help on how to update, and results from port scans. 

# Educational Goals: 

With the rising growth in IoT Security, this project will introduce students into the major problems of IoT Security including:
1. The growth of devices on each network
2. Updating
3. Protecting data
4. Making things easy for the lazy consumer

This project will also include Test Driven Development, source code management, and Internet Protocol applications inside java. 

# Proposed Contribution:
This project will be created from scratch and will be an open source project. There are a few programs readily available that accomplish the same goals, but with the rapid growth of IoT Security, the fundamentals are very important.
